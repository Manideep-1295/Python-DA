Case Study



### Variable 
Memory holder - singular value
Python is a type inference language
(Based)
Lazy evaluaiton  (No need of main method)
Diff variables with same value and data type point to same addr loc
Every varibale is an object


### Data Types
String
Int
Float
Boolean

List  
    - Heterogeneous type of data  
    - [] - syntax  
Tuple
    - Very much restricted
    - ()
Set
    - UNordered collection
    - {}

### FOR vs WHILE  
If there is no n values then we use WHILE
