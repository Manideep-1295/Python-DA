Why python is required for analysis?
1984 it is introduced for scientific calculaitons for scientists
Later after 2013-14, it came into the market for analysing the large amount of data.

### Agenda 
1. Basics
    - Variables
    - Data Types
    - Functions
    - Control Statements
2. OOPs
    - Class
    - Object
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstraction
3. Advanced 
    - Exceptions
    - Multi Threading
    - File Handling
4. Pandas
5. NumPy

Case Study



### Variable 
Memory holder - singular value  

>Python is a type inference language (Based)  

Lazy evaluaiton  (No need of main method)
Diff variables with same value and data type point to same addr loc
Every varibale is an object


### Data Types
String
Int
Float
Boolean

List  
    - Heterogeneous type of data  
    - [] - syntax  
Tuple
    - Very much restricted
    - ()
Set
    - UNordered collection
    - {}

### FOR vs WHILE  
If there is no n values then we use WHILE


### Functions
```py
# Parameterized function
def function_name(parameters):
    #Statements

function_name(arguments)  # Calling a function
```



### Importing Modules
```py
from module_name import *
# With this syntax we dont need to give prefix of module_name

function()

import module_name # It imports all things without any restrictions
# With this syntax, we need to provide the module_name as prefix
module_name.function()

```

## OOPs
1. Class
    - Every class name has convention as Camel Case
    - Doesn't holds memory
    - Its a blueprint/plan/structure
2. Object 
    - Its a reference to access the class properties
    - self is just like object 
3. Inheritance
    - types
    - Single
    - Multi level
    - Multiple
    - Hybrid
4. Polymorphism
    - Compile Time
    - Run Time

### Multi-Threading
- Run()
- Start()
- Join()

### File Handling
1. Read
2. Write
4. Append
### Lambda Funcitons
lambda arguments:expression
### Map
map(function,collection)
### Filter
filter(function with condition,collection)
### Reduce
reduce(func with xprsn, collection)
func with xprsn includes the operation to be done to cumulate sum or multiplication

### Iterators
