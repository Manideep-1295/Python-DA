Write a function with the name get_discount that takes the bill amount as an argument. 

- If the bill amount is less than 500, the discount should be "5%". 

- If the bill amount is greater than or equal to 500 and less than 2500, the discount should be "10%"

Write a function with the name show_number that takes a number N and print all the numbers from 0 to N with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. 

Write a program with a function name as func() to return the value passwd to the function. 

For the problem , the prefilled code will contain a function. Write a program that the given function will return the perimeter of the square. 

The sum of the lengths of the four sides of square is the perimeter of the square. 

( 

def perimeter_of_square(arg_1): 

    # Write your code here 

 

side = int(input()) 

result = perimeter_of_square(side) 

print(result) 

 

) 

A function is given in prefilled code that takes a number N as an argument. 

Write a program that checks if N is less than 1000 

Return 5% of the N if N is less than 1000. Otherwise, return 10% of the N. 

{ 

def calculate_percentage(number): 

     

    # complete this function 

 

number = int(input()) 

result = # Call the calculate_percentage function 

print(result) 

 

} 

Write a function with the name get_speed_status that takes the speed(S) as an argument. 

If the speed is less than 60, it should return "Normal" 

If the speed is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 80, it should return "Warning" 

If the speed is greater than or equal to 80, it should return "Over Speed" 

{ 

def get_speed_status(speed): 

    # Complete this function 

 

speed = int(input()) 

# Call the get_speed_status function 

 

} 

 

A function is given in prefilled code that takes a string S as an argument. 

Write a program that prints the count of uppercase letters in the given string S. 

{ 

 def count_of_uppercase(word): 

     

    # complete this function 

 

word = input() 

result = # Call the count_of_uppercase function 

print(result) 

 

} 

Write a function with the name validate_atm_pin_code that takes a word as an argument. 

ATM PIN is considered only if the given word contains 

Exactly 4 or 6 characters 

All the characters should be digits 

Explanation 

----- 

For Example "2345" is just an number and it is a valid number with digits. 

If it is ab4534j then it is not just an number and it is not a valid string. 

{ 

def validate_atm_pin_code(pin): 

    # Complete this function 

 

pin = input() 

# Call the validate_atm_pin_code function 

}
